**Scope:** Attendance Record · GA Extension · Supervision · GA/GRA Certification Letter. Proactive intervention and document workflow automation.

## Built

- **GA Extension** — complete. Supervisor → CGS Staff → Senior Director CGS,
  with a required supporting document enforced at validation so incomplete
  applications never reach CGS.

- **Attendance Record** — complete. UTrace data comes in as a CGS-uploaded
  CSV (`/attendance/upload`), not a live API — there's no UTP system access
  for this FYP; see `Support\AttendanceRiskEvaluator` for the rule-based
  early-warning logic (threshold + declining-trend) and
  `Notifications\AttendanceAtRisk` for the proactive alert. The appeal chain
  (`attendance_appeal`) is a single stage straight to Non-Executive CGS.

- **Supervision** — complete. Supervisor → CGS eligibility review. CGS's
  approval sets `users.supervisor_id`. Because the engine can't yet scope a
  queue to a *specific* person (only a role — see TODO.md's cross-cutting
  notes), `SupervisionController` adds its own guard so a supervisor only
  ever sees and can act on requests actually addressed to them. Stall
  reminders run daily via `supervision:remind-stalled`.

- **GA/GRA Certification Letter** — complete. CGS verify GA/GRA →
  Senior Director CGS endorses → Dompdf generates the certificate and
  `DocumentStore::storeGenerated()` attaches it, so the existing download
  route and permission check apply with no extra code.

## The three rules

1. **Only edit files inside this folder.** If you need something from
   `Core/`, raise it with the team — it affects all six of us.
2. **Your `module_type` must be unique.** Claim it in `docs/module-keys.md`.
3. **Never write `status` or `current_stage` yourself.** Call
   `WorkflowEngine::submit()` and `::decide()`.

See `docs/adding-a-module.md` for the full walkthrough.
