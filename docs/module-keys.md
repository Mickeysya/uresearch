# `module_type` registry

Every application type needs a unique key. It is stored in
`applications.module_type` on every row, so **it is permanent** — renaming one
means writing a data migration.

Add a row here in the same commit that registers the workflow.

## Stage keys in use

Stage keys only need to be unique **within one chain**, so reusing `supervisor`
across modules is fine and desirable — it keeps the vocabulary consistent.

| Key | Label | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `supervisor` | Lecturer/Supervisor | `supervisor` |
| `chair` | Chair of Department | `chair` |
| `cgs_review` | Non-Executive CGS | `non_exec_cgs` |
| `cgs_verify` | CGS Staff | `non_exec_cgs` |
| `dean` | Dean of PGR | `dean_pgr` |
| `senior_director` | Senior Director CGS | `senior_director_cgs` |
| `manager` | Manager CGS | `manager_cgs` |
| `academic_exec` | Academic Executive | `academic_exec` |
| `cgs_approve` | Senior Executive CGS | `senior_exec_cgs` |
